Reinforcement learning:
Teaching a software agent how to behave in an envrionment by telling it how good it is.

Q-learning:
Use a neural network to train the model

Steps:

Game (Pygame)
-play_step(action) -> reword, game_over, score
Agent
Training, state, action, reward,

Model(PyTorch)


Reward:
Food + 10
GameOver - 10
Else 0

Action
[1, 0, 0] -> straight
[0, 1, 0] -> right turn
[0, 0, 1] -> left turn


State : model needs to know about the environment

Test the following information : Danger, direction, food (boolean value)


Model:
